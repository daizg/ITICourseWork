Human Computer Interaction (ITI) Final Project

https://sites.google.com/site/hci230finalproj/

As a group you will be implementing an Android app and going through the development and 
design process. Just make sure you pick something that's doable and pertains to practicing
theories and concepts we learn in the HCI class. This means, your project will have to go 
through understanding users (stage#2), lo-fi prototype (stage#3), hi-fi prototype 
(stage#4), and heuristic evaluation (stage#5). You will also be doing project presentation 
(stage#6) and submitting a project report (stage#7).
